# Pulsar-Cage-Library
For further development and free access of Pulsar-size cages. 

All designs in this library are free to use and modify for personal use as per the license - please get in touch with me if you are interested in selling cages. 

You may use the STRS_H2 file or any other .f3d files you find as a jumping-off point, I'll be happy to provide specific .f3d or STEP files of the latest batch upon request. 
Contact me at kurymakesthings@gmail.com or on Discord (Kuryaka #0932) in the BAFT or /r/Nerf servers (or wherever you happen to find me!) if you have questions or source file requests. 

Quick design guidelines: 

Wheel OD is 30.4mm. 

Wheel well diameter is 32mm but may be pushed to 31.5mm if you really need the space. 

Hurricane-size motor wells work with 2 perimeters (0.8mm walls). Use multiples of your line thickness to avoid odd artifacting issues.
