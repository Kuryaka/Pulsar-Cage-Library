# Gryphon-DualPulsar

Dual stage Gryphon parts for Pulsar and other Hurricane size wheels. 

Cage attaches to the main body with all 4 screws, and flash hider attaches to cage with all 3 screws. This makes the core of the blaster more sturdy, at the cost of flimsier/uglier covers. Covers could be improved at the cost of printability, STEP and F3Z files are included if you want to prettify it.

Updated covers attach to the main cage via two m3x5mm screws each. 

Picatinny rail has been lengthened to fit the dual stage setup, with clearance holes for the top cover socket screws. Attach to the cage via m3 x 8mm screw, same as usual.
